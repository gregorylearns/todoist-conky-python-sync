# todoist-conky-python-sync
A little script i made in order to sync my Today list into conky.


# Features
Nothing special here, it simply syncs Today list and adds it to your conkyrc.

It finds the text captures string in your conkyrc and adds it inside them.

There are no error catching, unfortunately. This works for me
